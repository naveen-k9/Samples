Run the solve.py file to play sudoku.

Then press spacebar, it starts solving the sudoku using backtracking.

Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.
